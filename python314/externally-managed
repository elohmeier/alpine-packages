 This Python installation is managed by the system package manager (apk).

 If the package in question is not packaged already, please consider
 installing it inside a virtual environment, e.g.:

   python3.14 -m venv /path/to/venv
   . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
   pip install mypackage

 To exit the virtual environment, run:

   deactivate

 The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by re-sourcing
 the activate file.

 To automatically manage virtual environments, consider using pipx (from the
 pipx package).
